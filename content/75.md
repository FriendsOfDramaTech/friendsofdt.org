Friends of DramaTech will host an alumni weekend April 21-23, 2023, celebrating DramaTech's 75th Anniversary. Join us in Atlanta for a weekend of events where you will interact with old friends, learn what's going on at the theater, and see DramaTech's spring musical, RENT.

## RSVP and Tickets
Your 75th Anniversary Alumni Weekend ticket is $80 and includes Saturday lunch, a ticket to see RENT at DramaTech on Saturday night, and Sunday brunch. You do not need to buy a separate ticket to see the show.

## Travel Details
We're hoping that folks who don't live in Atlanta will consider traveling for this event.

The most convenient hotel to Georgia Tech is the [Hampton Inn on North Ave](https://www.hilton.com/en/hotels/atlgthx-hampton-atlanta-georgia-tech-downtown/hotel-location/). You can find other options for each of the major hotel rewards programs at [this link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qOdz8mpclvKjfFOoXJSmZJsmib2g2Wte5bT3vBGQWlU).

For getting around, we recommend Lyft or Uber, or perhaps renting a car. There is paid parking at the Student Center ([Visitor Area 2 and 3](https://www.pts.gatech.edu/parking/visitor-parking/)). If you’re using an app or need directions, try Georgia Tech Student Center or 351 Ferst Drive NW.

## Share and Enjoy!
If you know of any DramaTech alumni who might not be on our email list, please feel free to invite them. We'd love to have as many people who were involved with the theater present. They can also get future updates about this sort of thing by email by [joining Friends of DramaTech](https://friendsofdt.org/join).
