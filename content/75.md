## RENT Details
If you have a ticket to the alumni weekend, you already have a ticket to see RENT at DramaTech on Saturday night. We will distribute tickets at lunch on Saturday, and there will be somebody from FoDT in front of the theatre before the show as well. We will have a block of seats together, so look for seats marked for Friends of DramaTech. The lobby opens at 7:00 PM and the house opens at 7:30 PM. If something comes up and you will be unable to attend the show, please let us know at <a href="&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;&#58;&#55;&#53;&#116;&#104;&#64;&#102;&#114;&#105;&#101;&#110;&#100;&#115;&#111;&#102;&#100;&#116;&#46;&#111;&#114;&#103;">&#55;&#53;&#116;&#104;&#64;&#102;&#114;&#105;&#101;&#110;&#100;&#115;&#111;&#102;&#100;&#116;&#46;&#111;&#114;&#103;</a> any time up until showtime and we’ll make sure somebody gets to use it.

## Parking and Transportation
For getting around, we recommend Lyft or Uber, or perhaps renting a car. There is paid parking at the Student Center - we recommend the deck ([Visitor Area 3](https://www.pts.gatech.edu/parking/visitor-parking/)). If you’re using an app or need directions, try searching for “Georgia Tech Student Center Parking” or 353 Ferst Drive NW. If you’re driving, the Student Center visitor parking is a little further up Ferst Drive (towards the rec center) from the Student Center. Cost is $2/hr and is pay-on-exit.
