Friends of DramaTech (FoDT) is a nonprofit organization dedicated to serving and providing social and networking opportunities to alumni and supporters of DramaTech Theatre, the student-run theatre at the Georgia Institute of Technology. FoDT acts to support and continue the mission of DramaTech and the theatre’s long, proud, and often quirky history. For many of us alumni, our participation in DramaTech was invaluable to our time at Georgia Tech. To this day, DramaTech provides a space for students to build a community and achieve goals outside of the classroom. FoDT is a way for that community to continue well past our graduation.

As part of our mission, FoDT coordinates with the Georgia Tech Foundation to award scholarships each year to students dedicated to supporting DramaTech and the arts on Georgia Tech’s campus. These scholarships are presented in honor of three individuals whose support and contributions have helped shape DramaTech into the theatre and organization that it is today.

As depicted in our logo, FoDT stands proudly with DramaTech at the intersection of theatre and kitchen appliances. It’s our “toaster dreams” that make us unique, and we celebrate that eccentricity and distinctiveness. We are more than seven decades’ worth of theatre alumni from a non-theatre school. And we didn’t just make theatre - we engineered theatre. And toast.
