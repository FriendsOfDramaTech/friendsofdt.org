Fall is officially here! Well, fall semester that is. Don't break out your FoDT jumpers just yet - might still be a bit toasty for that - but feel free to pour yourself a pumpkin spice latte into your DT logo mug. You don't have one? Well, neither do we - but if you by chance wanted one, you could mention that in our half-year check-in survey! More on that below. (Editor's note: The FoDT Board in no way endorses the consumption of pumpkin spice lattes. Consume at your own risk.)

Speaking of fall: DramaTech kicked off the semester with a socially-distanced Open House, including two virtual showcases - one of which featured a surprise cameo by a couple of FoDT members! The theatre followed up Open House with virtual auditions for 45 Plays for 45 Presidents and a set of student-directed one acts. The former runs (ha! political joke) September 25th through October 3rd, so we'll be sure to bring you more information about an alumni night next month.

## How are we doing?
Back in February, we sent out a survey asking you what you would like to see from FoDT leadership. Now we would like to know how we have been doing. If you could please take a moment to fill out this survey, we would greatly appreciate it.

## October Virtual Happy Hour
Save the date! Let’s celebrate the fall on October 17th at 8 pm EDT/5 pm PDT via Gather. Enjoy fall-themed games and prepare your own spoopy treats and drinks. Dress in your favorite costumes to participate in the costume contest. We’ll even have a corn maze and a pumpkin patch. More details to come next month!

## Q3 Membership Meeting
We know how much you all love our quarterly meetings! So let's do it again in September. Our next full membership meeting will be September 26th at 6 pm EDT/3 pm PDT. We'll share the meeting link in next month's newsletter.

## Membership Call
Hey! You! Yeah - you! Do you stay in touch with friends you met at DT? Are they receiving our newsletter and following us on social media? If not, you should be a good friend and let them know about FoDT. Because friends don't let friends miss FoDT newsletters. 

## Fundraising for DramaTech Scholarships
FoDT is working to fully fund all scholarships awarded to DramaTech students. Once endowed, the scholarship will be available to DramaTech students in perpetuity. Right now, your donation goes 2x as far with a matching donation!

The Gay Dull Scholarship is over 90% funded and only needs another $1,200 in donations to reach our goal! Thank you to everyone who has donated and helped FoDT get to this point. Your generosity toward the future generations of DramaTech never ceases to amaze and inspire us.

We hope you'll contribute towards achieving our goal. To make a tax-deductible donation, check out the How To Donate section on FriendsofDT.org. During this campaign, donations are being matched dollar-for-dollar up to a total of $20,000.
