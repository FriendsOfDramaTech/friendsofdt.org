This year I am thankful for the fact that more than 130 of you open this newsletter each month and read my ramblings. I am also thankful for my fellow Board members, for my committee chairs, for the members of each committee, and for your unwavering support for the students of DramaTech Theatre. And for grocery delivery services - those came in clutch in 2020.

As we reflect on all that we are grateful for this year, I hope you will consider giving back to the theatre we all love - either through a tax-deductible donation to the scholarship fund, or through a little bit of your time. Our goals for FoDT are twofold: provide DT alumni with a forum to reconnect, and provide current DT students with the same opportunities we enjoyed. I appreciate anything you can do to further either goal.

As always, we look forward to your thoughts and your feedback. Email us at [board@friendsofdt.org](mailto:board@friendsofdt.org) with any questions or comments you might have. And, again, thank you!

**#GivingTuesday**  
Tuesday, December 1st is #GivingTuesday - and what better time is there to consider donating to the DramaTech scholarships fund? The Gay Dull Scholarship is more than 90% endowed - and we need your help to take it that little bit further. Next Tuesday, we hope you will consider taking advantage of our dollar-for-dollar match in order to help us guarantee we can continue offering this scholarship in perpetuity. Find out how to donate at [FriendsofDT.org](https://dramatech.us11.list-manage.com/track/click?u=8c474d14d7dee640868d40231&id=4d51cf6033&e=1393253293), and reach out to [treasurer@friendsofdt.org](mailto:treasurer@friendsofdt.org) with questions. Don't forget: corporate matching deadlines are coming up, so if you are donating, check with your employer to see if they offer matching funds.

**Silent Auction Committee Call**  
We are putting out the call for anyone interested in serving on the Silent Auction Committee. The silent auction will go to benefit the Gay Dull and Greg Abbott Scholarships.

**Scholarship Committee Chair Call**  
We are also putting out the call to chair the Scholarship Committee in 2021. This committee is tasked with developing and judging the scholarship applications. If you are interested, please send me an email at [chair@friendsofdt.org](mailto:chair@friendsofdt.org) with a brief explanation of why you are interested and any relevant experience.

**Q4 Membership Meeting**  
We have set the date for the final membership meeting of the year. Join us on **December 12** at **6 pm EST/3 pm PST** to receive updates from the Board and provide feedback. We are still working on the agenda, but if there is anything you want to discuss, please email [chair@friendsofdt.org](mailto:chair@friendsofdt.org).
