Happy Spooky (or Spoopy, if you will) Season everyone! Let's be real: is there any holiday more beloved for members of the theatre world than Halloween? I mean, it's a day in which you're supposed to dress up and be a character (rather than those other days when we dress up without an excuse and just get strange looks for doing so...).

I want to give a huge shout out to Savannah Cookson and Katie Zimmerman for putting together another fabulous alumni happy hour - the Board and I are incredibly grateful for all the work Savannah and Katie have put into making these happy hours so much fun for everyone who has attended! Thank you, both!

As always, please don't hesitate to reach out the Board at board@friendsofdt.org if you have any thoughts for the organization, future events or programming, or just want to share your and your family's Halloween costumes!

## A Night of One Acts
The students in Artistic Director Melissa Foulger's intro to directing class are putting on an evening of student-directed one acts, November 13-21. We haven't set an alumni night viewing for the production, but we hope you tune in to support these burgeoning directors. Tickets will be on sale soon on DramaTech's website.

## Silent Auction Committee Call
We are putting out the call for anyone interested in serving on the Silent Auction Committee. The silent auction will go to benefit the Gay Dull and Greg Abbott Scholarships. If you are interested in joining this committee, please email silentauction@friendsofdt.org.
 
## Fundraising for DramaTech Scholarships
Speak of scholarships, we are so close to endowing the Gay Dull Scholarship. Don't forget we have a generous matching donation, which will help your money go twice as far. As many companies' matched have deadlines coming up in November and December, now is the best time to see if your donation will go twice as far thanks to a company match. Your donation is tax-deductible; more information is available in the How To Donate section on FriendsofDT.org. Thank you, as always, for helping provide current students with the same opportunities we had.
