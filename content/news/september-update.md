How is everyone this month? Have you registered to vote? If it weren't for voters like you, there'd be less fodder for DramaTech's next performance: 45 Plays for 45 Presidents. This wild romp will take us through more than 230 years of American history, told in vignettes, songs, comedy roasts, and more about our storied Commanders in Chief. So, if you voted for any of the first 45, this one's for you! And if you voted for any of the first 31, can you share with the rest of us the location of the Fountain of Youth? Thanks.

Anyway, several events for you to get involved with this go-around. As always, let us know if you have comments or questions by emailing us at board@friendsofdt.org. We love receiving your feedback! (Such as the Board performing all future newsletters in interpretive dance. We have taken this piece of feedback under serious consideration.)

## Q3 Membership Meeting
The time has come, the Walrus said, to talk of many things: of boards — and laws — and membership — of fundraising — and kings — and why the sea is boiling hot — and whether pigs have wings. Our full membership meeting will be Saturday, September 26th at 6 pm EDT/3 pm PDT. So, if you don't want FoDT to install a king (or queen, or non-gender-specific royal personage), join Us Saturday on Zoom at http://bit.ly/fodt20q3. And, yes, that "Us" was the Royal We.

## Alumni Night and Fall Festival
Join FoDT on October 9th for an alumni night viewing of 45 Plays for 45 Presidents. Keep your eyes on DramaTech's website for information about tickets and the performance livestream. Tickets will be available starting within the next couple of days. If you can't join us for alumni night, be sure to check out one of their other performances: the show runs from October 2nd to October 10th. And watch the website for more information on the theatre's Fall Festival performance on October 16th. Here's one of those handy calendar buttons for the alumni night:

## October Virtual Happy Hour
Celebrate autumn with Friends of DramaTech! On October 17th at 8 pm EDT/ 5 pm PDT, we’ll hang out in Gather to enjoy some traditional fall festivities, with fun for all ages! Enjoy a virtual corn “maize” and search our digital pumpkin patch for the largest pumpkin. Play seasonal games and prepare your own themed drinks and treats! Connect to the event on Facebook or email the Board for updates.

Missing Halloween this year? Join the costume contest as either a contestant or judge! Please note that photos are required to enter as a contestant; entries due October 10th. Judges will score our contestants on creativity, authenticity, and effort. Categories will be based on submissions. Need a reminder? Here's a nifty little calendar button for this event:

## Logo Design Call
The Friends of DramaTech Board is looking to develop an official logo for the organization. While we have some external resources, we wanted to put out one final call for any volunteer designers who know the theatre we love and know the alumni and want to be a part of designing something that says "we are professionals, but we also worship Velocitoasters." If you are interested in helping us create a cohesive brand, please reach out to us at board@friendsofdt.org.

Fundraising for DramaTech Scholarships
We are still working to fully fund all of the scholarships awarded to DramaTech students each year. Unfortunately, our efforts have slowed down recently, but we're almost all the way to funding the Gay Dull Scholarship. Because your dollars go twice as far thanks to a generous matching donation, we are more than 90% of the way to our goal of endowing this scholarship. 

We know times are unstable, but every dollar helps. If you can give just a few dollars to this cause, it would go a long way to helping current and future students continue to pursue their academic dreams while enjoying the theatre as much as we all did. To make a tax-deductible donation, check out the How To Donate section on FriendsofDT.org. During this campaign, donations are being matched dollar-for-dollar up to a total of $20,000.
